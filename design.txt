thething.ee/                            - Main page - can be configured to show a specific page. Otherwise shows default 'blog layout'
¤thething.ee/{string}                    - Checks datatypes first and if doesn't exist checks tag also if user is allowed to see tag. 
¤thething.ee/{string}/{integer}          - Same as above, but integer shows pagenumber
¤thething.ee/{long}                      - Returns thing by id, if thing has only single tag and the tag has settings, then redirect is done to correct tag
thething.ee/{string}/{string}           - First is datatype, second is tag. Shows a certain tag, but only one type of things.
thething.ee/{string}/{long}/{string}    - Same as above, but string is title. This is the preffered pattern for most things.
thething.ee/b/{integer}                 - 'Blog', integer shows page.
